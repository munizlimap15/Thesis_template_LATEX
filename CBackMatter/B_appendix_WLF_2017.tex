This publication suggests a very first attempt to model the Austrian territory through data-driven, statistical modeling. The overall milestone from this publication was to identify potential flawless and weaknesses from large territory modeling using a standard research design. The hypothesis is that most large territories modeling would face similar problems as the Austrian territory did. Once identified, these weaknesses could be then counteracted in future research. Indeed consequences of biased landslide inventories were identified in the outcomes. The corresponding author, \textbf{Pedro Lima} was responsible to write the main parts of this manuscript and do the modeling part. The co-author Stefan Steger, supported intensively these processes, while Thomas Glade contributed with scientific input during the discussion and with feedback on the manuscript. There was also strong collaboration from the Geological Survey of Austria (Nils Tilch, Leonhard Schwarz and Arben Kociu), also offering important input data sets.
